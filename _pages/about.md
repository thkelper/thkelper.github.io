Hi there 👋. Welcome to Kelper Young(杨昌澎)'s Page! I'm currently pursuing graduate studies at [Peking University(PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/)'s Cell Mechanics Lab, supervised by [Prof. Chunyang Xiong(熊春阳)](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891204.htm). My research is dedicated to the deep learning and multi-modal analysis of cellular data, encompassing both imagery and multiomics.

I got my bachelor degree from the [University of Shanghai for Science and Technology(USST)](https://en.usst.edu.cn/), majored in Information Management and Information System, supervised by [Asst. Prof. Baizhou Shi(施柏州)](https://www.iem.yuntech.edu.tw/faculties1.php?ename=pcshih). His enlightening guidance ignited my passion for artificial intelligence.

Now I'm looking for a Ph.D. position in 2024 fall to further my research ambitions, which involve designing automated high-throughput wet lab protocols and utilizing deep learning techniques to analyze multi-modal cellular data, including microscopy images and multi-omics data. And I have a strong interest in developing an LLM-Agent integrating the above tools for biological research. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
