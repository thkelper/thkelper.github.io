Hi there 👋. Welcome to Changpeng Yang(杨昌澎)'s Page! I'm currently pursuing graduate studies at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/)'s Cell Mechanics Lab, supervised by [Chunyang Xiong(熊春阳)](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891204.htm). My research is dedicated to the deep learning and multi-modal analysis of cellular data, encompassing both imagery and multiomics.

I graduated with a B.Sc. from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, supervised by [Baizhou Shi(施柏州)](https://www.iem.yuntech.edu.tw/faculties1.php?ename=pcshih). His guidance ignited my passion for artificial intelligence, setting me on this exciting path.

I'm on the lookout for a Ph.D. position to further my research ambitions.if you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
