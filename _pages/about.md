Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my website! I'm currently pursuing graduate studies at Peking University's Cell Mechanics Lab, supervised by [ç†Šæ˜¥é˜³(Chunyang Xiong)](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/subpaget.asp?id=23). My research is dedicated to the multi-modal analysis of cellular data, encompassing both imagery and multiomics.

I graduated with a B.Sc. from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, supervised by [Baizhou Shi](https://www.iem.yuntech.edu.tw/faculties1.php?ename=pcshih). His guidance ignited my passion for artificial intelligence, setting me on this exciting path.

I'm on the lookout for a Ph.D. position to further my research ambitions., if you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
