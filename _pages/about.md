🐚 Hi there! Welcome to Kelper Young(杨昌澎)'s Page. I'm currently pursuing graduate studies at [Peking University(PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/)'s Cell Mechanics Lab, supervised by [Prof. Chunyang Xiong(熊春阳)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TFxaXggAAAAJ). My research is dedicated to the deep learning of multi-modal biomedical data analysis, encompassing both imagery and multiomics.

<!-- I got my bachelor degree from the [University of Shanghai for Science and Technology(USST)](https://en.usst.edu.cn/), majored in Information Management and Information System, supervised by [Asst. Prof. Baizhou Shi(施柏州)](https://www.iem.yuntech.edu.tw/faculties1.php?ename=pcshih). His enlightening guidance ignited my passion for artificial intelligence. -->

Now I'm looking for a Ph.D. position in 2024 to further my research ambitions, focusing on deep learning and multi-modal analysis in biomedical science. Please feel free to contact me if interested.

<!-- And I have a strong interest in developing an LLM-Agent integrating the above tools for biomedical research. -->
