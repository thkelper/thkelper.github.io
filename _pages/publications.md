description: I've made two cross-disciplinary major transitions during past academic journey. The first was from Management Science to Computer Science, which is during the third year of my undergraduate education. The second was from Computer Science to Cell Biology, the field that I'm currently working on, and this starts from my graduate application. Although transition normally means painful as it requires considerable time and effort to start from scratch, I enjoy the happiness to explore my research insterets. As I've managed to accumulate substantial knowledge in these fields, my research papers are now well on their way.
