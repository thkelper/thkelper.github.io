description: I've made two cross-disciplinary shifts in my academic journey. The first was from Management Science to Computer Science, and the second was from Computer Science to the application of Cell Biology. Each transition required considerable time and effort to start from scratch. However, I've managed to accumulate substantial knowledge in these fields, and my research papers are now well on their way.
