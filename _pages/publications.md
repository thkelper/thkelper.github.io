# description: I've made two cross-disciplinary major transitions during past academic journey. The first was from Management Science to Computer Science, which is during the third year of my undergraduate education. The second was from Computer Science to the application of Cell Biology, the field that I'm currently working on. Although transition normally means painful as it requires considerable time and effort to start from scratch, I retrospectively enjoy the process to explore my research insterets. As I've been accumulating substantial knowledge in these fields, my research papers are now well on their way
