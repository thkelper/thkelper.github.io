    The advent of large language models(LLM) has profoundly captured my interest. 
    Well after ending my internship at 4th Paradigm, almost half a year later, 
    my former mentor invited me to explore applications on LLM with him. 
    Having gained a preliminary understanding of multimodal cellular data, 
    I've recognized the substantial potential of LLM in contextual processing 
    for such complex information. For this purpose, I pursued this internship 
    with the aim of deepening understanding of advanced models, thereby enhancing 
    my future research and analysis in the realm of multimodal cellular data. 


&emsp;Over the past few months, I have embarked on an initial exploration of large models, delving into the development of LLMs across various domains.
 <br />&emsp;I've scrutinized the characteristics of raw data for our projects, begun engaging in prompt engineering, and developed effective prompts.
 <br />&emsp;I've utilized OpenAI's interfaces to develop assistant and completion strategies that to generate corpus in bulk. 
 <br />&emsp;Leveraging the Llama factory framework and the high-performing Chinese base model, Qwen, we've fine-tuned our first version of the model, which is still undergoing continuous research and improvement. 
 <br />&emsp;In 2024, we aim to explore and research the application of agent models in specific domains.
 <br />&emsp;I will gradually share my accumulated knowledge in this vast field here. Please stay tuned! And if you are interested in LLMs and this project, please feel free to contact me。
