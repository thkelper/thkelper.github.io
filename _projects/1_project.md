###  Traditional collagen gel contraction assay
&emsp;3D collagen gels have been widely used in the study of cell contraction, drug screen, integrin signaling, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal reorganization, offering more biological relevance in vitro than traditional 2D culture methods. <br />&emsp;The two-step adhesion model is a traditional and classic method for detecting cell contraction. It includes two steps: the accumulation of mechanical force generated by cell contraction within the adherent collagen matrix, and the release of the collagen matrix to produce contraction. 
<br />&emsp;However, the traditional two-step method is inconvenient and time-consuming to operate. Additionally, due to the excessive volume of collagen used in each experiment, the cost is extremely high, making it impractical for high-throughput, large-scale experiments.

### Droplet based collagen contraction gel assay
&emsp;Due to the many inconveniences and barriers posed by the traditional two-step method, droplet-based collagen contraction experiments are more suitable for high-throughput collagen gel contraction experiments, contributing to high-throughput drug screening.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
