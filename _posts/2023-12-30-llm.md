Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agentâ€™s brain, complemented by several key components:
1. Planning
    - Task Decomposition
    - Self-reflection
2. Memory
    - Types of Memory
        - Sensory Memory
        - Short-term Memory
        - Long-term Memory
    - Maximum Inner Product Search
3. Tool Use
    <br />&emsp;Tool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.
